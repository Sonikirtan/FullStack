# FullStack Project Details

I have been doing regular voluntary tech knowledge sharing with engineering college students.

The idea for this project is to start from scratch, like writing the first HTML tag from the notepad, which will slowly grow and make this project an entire site including cms, commerce, search considering the AI and all the latest innovation.

We didn't want to create the repository, but it's always good to keep track and see how we have started the knowledge sharing and this project.

I hope we all will grow together, and this repo will help others.
